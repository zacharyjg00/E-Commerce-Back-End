# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description
This is an app developed in node.js that uses an express.js API using sequlize to send information to a mySQL database containing information for an internet retail company. It allows the user to use an app such as Insomnia or Postman to use the CRUD routes that have been programmed to add, update, and delete new products, categories, and tags.

## Installation and Operation
In order to run this app, the user must first clone the repo locally and then navigate into the cloned repo. Once in the cloned repo, run `npm install`. The user should have mySQL workbench installed and should open and run the scheme.sql file found in the db folder in mySQL workbench before running the app. The next step that the user will need to do is create a .env file in their local repo. An example of what this file looks like is supplied in the .env.EXAMPLE file. After the previous steps have been completed, then the server can be started using `node server.js`. From there the user can user a program such as Insomnia or Postman to use the routes. Please refer to the video below to see how to operate the app if needed.
